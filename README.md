# baidu-doc(WIP)
Articles on [百度文库](https://wenku.baidu.com) are downloaded with 下载券 normally. TROUBLESOME, especially I have no 下载券 ! So I made this simple automatic tool to capture the article as images, then you can process these images as your mind, e.g. converting to pdf, merge them etc.

# Usage
This tool is WIP, now only DOC/PDF article can be captured

# Todo
- [x] Support DOC
- [x] Support PDF
- [x] Support XLS
